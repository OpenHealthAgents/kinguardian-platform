"""
Multimodal Wearable + Parent Check-in Correlation Test Suite.

Verifies:
1. Multimodal correlation between objective wearable metrics and subjective parent check-in responses.
2. Exact user scenario:
   Wearable: activity lower than baseline
   Parent: "Feeling okay"
   KinGuard: No urgent signal. Continue monitoring.
3. Invariant: Produces a contextual insight rather than a medical diagnosis.
