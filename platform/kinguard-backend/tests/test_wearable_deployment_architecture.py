"""
Open Wearables Deployment & Schema Isolation Test Suite.

Verifies:
1. Deployment Topology:
   - drgodly-api
   - open-wearables (separate service)
   - postgres (isolated databases)
   - redis
   - workers
2. Strict Schema & Database Isolation:
   - KinGuard connects to `kinguard_db`.
   - Open Wearables connects to `open_wearables_db`.
   - Avoid sharing Open Wearables' PostgreSQL schema with KinGuard.
